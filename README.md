# Human Rights First Police Use of Force Map - Front End

## Description ðŸ‘‡

> **Disclaimer:** This application is currently in Alpha (as of Oct 20, 2020) and is not ready for production. Please use at your own risk as things will change almost daily.

- Our team is developing an interactive map that identifies potential instances of police use of force across the United States of America for [Human Rights First](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/), an independent advocacy and action organization. We are also developing additional graphics to track and display police brutality trends.
- An application that takes information from data provided by the data science team collecting relevant incidents and data from Twitter, Reddit, and police agencies to display it on the map.
- This app will display various incidents of police use of force on a map that can be filtered by type of brutality and location with zipcodes and states.

## Deployed App

## âš  Contributing - future features needed/desired for this project:

> Please refer to the highlited parentheses statements throughout this ReadMe for better understanding

- Backend categorizing incidents by Rank (type of force)
- Incidents associated with one rank only (currently, a rank 5 incident will also appear in rank 4, rank 3, rank 2, rank 1 filters)
- Register/Login functionality added so that users can save queries to their account
- Ability for users to save queries to their account
- ability to apply and filter by date range
- ability to filter by source type
- Change graph to show different data (rather than just showing the same data in a different format)
  - Maybe implement the calendar instead.
